# LungCancer-Prediction-Using-CNN
# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using CNN

A deep learning-based application for detecting lung cancer from CT scan images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
The system is integrated with a **Streamlit** web interface, allowing users to upload lung CT scan images and receive real-time predictions indicating whether the scan is **Cancerous** or **Non-Cancerous**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload lung CT scan images directly in the Streamlit web app.
- Real-time prediction with confidence score.
- Preprocessing pipeline including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Trained CNN model with high accuracy for binary classification.
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users.
